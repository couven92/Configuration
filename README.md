# Environment Configuration files

This repository contains configuration files for the different programs I use daily.

This repository is mostly for my own convenience, but you are welcome to download, clone, fork these configuration as you like.

## Location

I usually keep the same (or at least similar) directory structure on all my computers and user-environment. The structure is heavily influenced by me using Windows most of the time.

| OS | Git clone |
| - | - |
| Windows | `git clone https://github.com/couven92/configuration.git -- "%APPDATA%\Configuration Repository"` |
| UNIX | `git clone https://github.com/couven92/configuration.git -- ~/.config/repository` |

Notice that both commands are completely agnostic to Username and other influencing factors.  
**Git will automatically create the folder if not present and will complain if it already *IS* present.**
